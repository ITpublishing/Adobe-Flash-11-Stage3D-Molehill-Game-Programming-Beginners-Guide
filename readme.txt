Overview of Adobe Flash 11 Stage3D (Molehill) Game Programming Beginner’s Guide

- The first book on Adobe's Flash 11 Stage3D, previously codenamed Molehill

- Build hardware-accelerated 3D games with a blazingly fast frame rate.

- Full of screenshots and ActionScript 3 source code, each chapter 
  builds upon a real-world example game project step-by-step.

- Light-hearted and informal, this book is your trusty sidekick on 
  an epic quest to create your very own 3D Flash game.




Adobe’s Stage3D (Molehill) is a set of 3D APIs that has brought 3D 
to the Flash platform. Being a completely new technology, there were 
almost no resources to get you acquainted with this revolutionary platform, until now.

This book will show you how to make your very own next-gen 3D games in Flash. 
If you have ever dreamed of writing your own console-style 3d game in Flash, 
get ready to be blown away by the hardware accelerated power of Stage3D. 
This book will lead you step-by-step through the process of programming a 
3D game in Actionscript 3 using this exciting new technology. Filled with 
examples, pictures and source code, this is a practical and fun-to-read 
guide that will benefit both 3D programming beginners and expert game developers alike.

Starting with simple tasks like setting up Flash to render a simple 3d shape, 
each chapter presents a deeper and more complete videogame as an example project. 
Right from a simple tech demo, your game will grow to become a finished product - 
your very own playable 3d game filled with animation, special effects, sounds, 
and tons of action. The goal of this book is to teach you how to program a 
complete game in Molehill that has a beginning, middle, and game over.

As you progress further into your epic quest, you will learn all sorts of useful 
tricks such as ways to create eye-catching special effects using textures, 
special blend modes for transparent particle systems, fantastic vertex and 
fragment programs that are used to craft beautiful shaders and much more. 
You will learn how to upload the geometry of your 3D models to video RAM 
for ultra-fast rendering. You will dive into the magical art of AGAL shader 
programming. You will learn optimization tricks to achieve blazingly fast 
frame rate even at full screen resolutions. With each chapter, you will 
“level up” your game programming skills, earning the title of Molehill Master – 
you will be able to honestly call yourself a 3D game programmer.

This book is written for beginners by a veteran game developer. It will
become your trusty companion filled with the knowledge you need to make 
your very own 3D games in Flash.
